# How the recommendation system works

1. A post has been successfully created or updated, and stored in the DB.

2. Keywords are generated by KeyBert asynchronously and stored in the "keywords"
   attribute to the post. This step takes around 3~6 seconds, depending on the size of the post content.

3. When a user clicks the "Recommendation" on the home page, the system does the following steps:

   a. Look for the recent 3 liked posts by the user;

   b. For each liked post, the system uses Mongoose Altas Search engine 'MoreLikeThis' to search for similar posts based on the keywords of the post, and returns up to 5 most similar posts.

   c. Pools the found similar posts (maximal 15 posts) together, return the list as the recommended posts for the user and presents them on the home page.
